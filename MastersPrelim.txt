\section{Introduction}
MALTA2 is a prototype of a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (DMAPS), a novel technology combining the front-end electronics and the active sensor area on the same silicon wafer. It has a pixel pitch of 36.4$\,\mu$m and a 2$\,\mu$m central octagonal collection electrode which results in low noise and low power dissipation due to the large $\frac{Q}{C}$ ratio \cite{Pernegger_2023}. This is an alternative to the currently popular hybrid approach which involves attaching the pixels to a separate set of readout electronics. By combining the two many benefits can be achieved such as reducing the amount of inactive material in a tracking detector, which reduces the amount of unnecessary multiple Coulomb scattering and therefore reduces the limiting effect this has on the resolution of the momentum. This new technology is consequently aimed at inner trackers of future high-flux experiments such as FCC, where many particle tracks will exist simultaneously and in time and space. In order to make more precise measurements the properties of the pixel need to be well understood. In particular, the electric field within the sensor is important as this has a significant effect on the efficiency of the charge collection as a function of the position of charge deposited within the pixel. 

One of the main issues with high-flux experiments is radiation damage. As a particle detector system is irradiated over time, ionising and non-ionising interactions occur which alter the structure of the detectors at the atomic or sub-atomic level. This ultimately changes the properties of the detector, and one of the main complications is traps. 

The Transient Current Technique (TCT) is a method of studying the properties of a semiconductor detector by injecting a thin laser of near-infrared light at different positions and measuring the induced current at the electrode due to the motion of the charge carriers. Edge-TCT (eTCT) adapts this method further to aim the laser normal to the side of a detector (parallel to the electrode) and vary the depth of the injection. The transient current recorded gives insight into the strength of the electric field at the depth injected. The electric field within MALTA2 is currently not well understood so this study will allow for the improvement of the precision of the measurements taken by MALTA2 by determining what the electric field looks like within MALTA2.

\section{Theory}
A P-N junction is created when an N-type and P-type semiconductor are placed in contact. The excess electrons from the N-type drift across the boundary to fill the gaps where electrons are missing in the P-type. This creates a small charge imbalance across the boundary so an electric field is induced, which opposes this drift until it is strong enough to stop it entirely, creating a thin equilibrium region. The number of free charge carriers here is small, so the conduction band is almost empty across the boundary. This thin section is called the depletion region\,\cite{knoll2010radiation}. 

A reverse bias voltage counteracts this equilibrium, forcing more charge carriers to drift across the boundary. This extends the depletion region where the conduction band is empty. When a high-energy charged particle enters this region, it loses its energy through ionisation losses and promotes electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These begin drifting in opposite directions due to the electric field and as such they induce a current in the electrode. This current pulse can be integrated over the time it lasts to find the charge deposited in the detector by the particle. This information can be used either as a binary "hit" to know just that a particle has traversed the detector at a certain time, or considered in a more complex way, where the charge deposited can be used to make predictions of the energy of the incoming particle. 

In a common silicon detector, each electron-hole pair requires on average 3.63\,eV of energy to be produced, even though the difference between the minimum energy of the conduction band and the maximum energy of the valence band is 1.12\,eV. This is because silicon is an indirect semiconductor. While the maximum and minimum values have an absolute offset of 1.12\,eV, their positions differ in k-space (or momentum space). This requires the incoming particle to deposit the energy difference and the momentum difference for momentum conservation to be fulfilled and the gap to be jumped. Photons on the other hand interact one-on-one with the electrons in the valence band.

\section{Experimental Apparatus and Procedure}
The general set-up for TCT/eTCT measurements is shown in figure [FIGURE]. A fibre-coupled laser is sent into a set of optics which focus the beam to a point. This point is aimed at a sensor placed atop a 2D stage, which can be moved remotely and scan the sensor through the beam. The optics can also be moved up and down to ensure the sensor is at the vertical focal point of the beam. Generally, a beam splitter is placed before the optics to send a fraction of the laser through a beam monitor, which can be used to confirm the state of the laser externally, along with the laser's trigger output. 

The laser used for TCT measurements is near-infrared at 1064nm with a power of 100\,mW. This classifies it as 3B on the laser classification scheme\,\cite{PHE-Lasers}. In this classification, even a visible laser could permanently damage the eye before the natural aversion reflex (blinking) could begin, even from reflected beams. The near-infrared (and hence invisible) laser used in TCT measurements is therefore a significant hazard to the user, especially as a system is being used to focus it, and many steps need to be taken to protect against this. The entire set-up is enclosed in a light-tight aluminium box, fitted with an interlock system. The interlock is physical; when the door is opened, a small metal "key" attached to it is removed from the interlock box. This key bridges the power line for the laser, and hence when removed the laser is powered off. Further safety considerations involve grounding the box in case the laser power supply shorts to it, and a sign on the box warning of class 3B laser radiation. 

The optical system used to focus the laser is a "ThorLabs GBE15-B Achromatic Galilean Beam Expander". Galilean beam expanders are an optical system designed to increase the width of a collimated beam by passing it through a negative lens to diverge it, and then a positive lens to recollimate it. The lens must be separated by the sum of their focal lengths for this to work. They generally include a collimator lens at the start to help parallelise the incoming rays. When the collimator is positioned such that the rays are converging when they meet the negative lens, the optics now have a focusing effect.

Optics (variables)


Stage (code and safety)
The 2D stage system is a remote method of positioning the sensor within the beam path. It has a single step resolution of 2.5\,$\mu$m, and a 1/256 microstep mode (resulting in an ultimate resolution of $\approx$10\,nm). It can be controled by a set of external manual controllers, a piece of control software, or a program in many different languages. The stage has a threaded shaft which spins, moving the platform in the X \& Y directions. The laser optics are also held on a vertical stage allowing for its focal plane to be placed on the plane of the sensor. The motion of the stage and the threaded shaft is a hazard to the experiment, especially the fibre optic cables for the laser and the high voltage cables for biasing the sensor. If either of those were to become trapped in the stage, they could break, potentially discharging a high current. To combat this, the fibre optic cables are suspended from the roof of the box and the electronics cables are kept all to one side, keeping them both away from the moving parts of the stage.

\section{Preliminary Results and Analysis}
To test the apparatus, the first goal was to reproduce some TCT results from the previous user, shown in the this by Mulvey,2024 \cite{JonathanThesis}. The results from this are shown in figure \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{}%
    \label{fig:PiNvsLGAD}%
\end{figure}

Both plots show a large ratio between the LGAD and PiN signals. 
The gain between the two is related to the ratio of their integrals. Calculating this, and assuming they had the same charge injected, the gain is around 7x in figure \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}b. Both plots also show that both the PiN and the LGAD show a reflected pulse around 40ns later in figure \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}a and 15ns later in figure \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}b. This is caused by reflection from the different impedances at the oscilloscope terminal and the amplifier terminal. In the case if \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}a, the length of the BNC cable was longer and was replaced with a shorter one when the set-up was moved between labs, causing the reflection to be quicker in figure \ref{fig:PiNvsLGAD}b. Despite these minor differences, the relative shapes and sizes of these pulses are a nice match with the work of J.Mulvey and this confirms that the set-up is working as expected. 

The above data was taken by aligning the laser by eye with the appropriate sensor, using a small low-power laser pointer. This system was not ideal as the angle of the laser pointer depended highly on the user's position and was a very unreliable alignment system. Since it was a different wavelength to the IR laser used for the measurements, it was also not possible to ensure the sensor was on the focal plane of the optics, as this is dependent of the wavelength of the light. 

To work around this, a camera with a small but non-zero quantum efficiency in the near IR range was purchased. This could be bolted to the stage in place of the sensor and the beam spot photographed as a function of height. The camera has a 4K sensor matrix with square 2\,$\mu$m pixels. Photographs of the beam were taken at various heights going into and out of the focal plane. These photos were fitted using a constrained Gaussian, where it was forced to reach the absolute peak and fit the thickness at the FWHM, ignoring the tails. The widths were then collected and plotted using a Python package called "laserbeamsize", shown in figure \ref{fig:BeamProfiles}.

    \caption{The 1/$e^{2}$ width of the beam as a function of distance from the focus for a) the x direction and b) the y direction.}%
    \label{fig:BeamProfiles}%
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:BeamProfiles} shows the 1/$e^{2}$ width of the beam as a function of distance from the focus for the x direction in (a) and the y direction in (b). The x and y directions are considered separately as the beam is slightly elliptical, however, the semi-major and minor axes are not directly aligned with the x and y axes. This is ignorable for now as the ellipse maintains the same orientation at all times so this measure of width is valid as long as it is not compared to data from a different optical system. 
In the plot, $\mathrm{w_0}$ is the waist - the radial width at the smallest point, $\mathrm{Z_R}$ is the Rayleigh range, the distance required for the beam's cross-section to double (or for $\mathrm{w_0} \rightarrow \sqrt{2}\mathrm{w_0}$), and $\mathrm{M^2}$ is the ratio of the "Beam Parameter Product" (BPP) of the beam to an ideal Gaussian beam. A Gaussian beam always has a Gaussian profile over the transverse intensity no matter where it is measured. The BPP is the product of the waist and the half angle at a great distance, usually using the paraxial approximation of sin($\theta$) = $\theta$. For a Gaussian beam, $\mathrm{M^2}$ is unity. Of course, no beam is perfectly Gaussian, so $\mathrm{M^2}>1$. This tells us the limiting factor of this experiment. To perform eTCT on MALTA2 sensors, the beam must be small on the scale of the thickness of the sensor. MATLA2 has an active depth of around 30\,$\mu$m, so a beam of 6-8\,$\mu$m wide at its thinnest is appropriate while slightly large. A Rayleigh range of 125\,$\mu$m is good however, as the size of a single MATLA2 pixel in either direction is 36.4\,$\mu$m, therefore it is valid to approximate the beam's width as invariant.

\section{Project Plan}
With approximately 10 weeks of data taking left, the remainder of the project will focus on TCT \& eTCT measurements. The first step is to establish the method of focusing the beam. This will either be done by focusing it on the camera and translating this to the sensor via a set of precise measurements, or by varying the height and using the scanning method until the focus is found. The former is quicker but more susceptible to errors on the measurements, whereas the latter will take much longer unless a program is written to automate it. It is expected this will take around two weeks. Next, the first eTCT measurements can be taken. This can be done by rotating the sensor and its mount by 90\textdegree such that the side of the sensor is normal to the beam, using one of the focusing methods and then taking measurements at varying thicknesses in the pixel. This will be done using the PiN diode to begin with, as this will simplify the simulation work done in parallel by A. Harrison. It is hoped that the first measurements will be taken within a week of starting. In the case that some MALTA2 sensors can be sourced, these will then be placed in the set-up, and measurements taken in the TCT and eTCT modes. This will allow for a comparison between the data of the PiN diode and MALTA2
